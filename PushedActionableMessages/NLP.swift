/** Shows how natural language processing can be used to extract actions from messages. It is a naive implementation but the aim is just to show an interesting possibility. Verbs/actions to look out for can be defined in a database that can be updated remotely to allow ability to add actions dynamically. How they are handled can also be defined by rules in a database. With time we can use methods like **link grammar** parsing to extract actions from any sentence.
